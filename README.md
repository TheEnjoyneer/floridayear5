Personal GitHub repository for archiving code written for classes at the University of Florida
  > `During the 2023-2024 Academic Year`
  
  > `Any code or files pertaining to research in either the FICS or Nelms IoT Labs is located elsewhere in a private repo`

All code in this repository is free for anyone's use. I doubt it will be too terribly useful to very many people.
Any comments, constructive criticism, or concerns can be emailed to me or commented on the repo as well.

Fall 2023 Semester contents should include code written and documents for Florida's graduate courses in:
  > `EEL 5718 - Computer Communications`
  
  
  All constructive comments are appreciated.
